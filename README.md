apriori
=======

Implementation of apriori algorithm to find frequent field-value 'itemsets' in maintenance record structured data fields.

This was part of a class project for CSCE 822 (Data Mining), Fall 2013.
The idea is to treat field-value combinations in maintenance record
structured data as itemsets and mine the records for frequently
occurring patterns of items.  These would then be compared against
references in the records' free text fields to determine the value of
structured data for normalizing variation in free text references to
part names.
